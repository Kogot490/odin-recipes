Starting the recipes project now, hope to make use of all HTML knowledge gained so far.

Finished.  Pretty simple once I got the first recipe built, I copy and pasted and changed the relevant info for the new recipes. Had trouble with getting images from the recipe site so I just googled images for the sangria and tomato recipes.
